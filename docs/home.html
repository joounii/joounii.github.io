<p>Hi, I’m Joounii, a 18 years old, passionate software developer with a diverse background in various programming languages and technologies. My journey in coding started back in 7th grade, where I was first introduced to programming through <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/forlegerhugo/">Scratch</a>, a beginner-friendly platform. From there, my interest in development quickly grew when a friend introduced me to <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> where I began learning the fundamentals of game development. Though I started with just the basics, it set the foundation for my future in coding.<br/><br/>
    After diving into HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript on my own, I took a major step forward in my career by joining <a href="https://www.open-circle.ch">Open Circle</a> after 9th grade. I joined the company as an apprentice software developer. During my apprenticeship, I gained hands-on experience in full-stack web development. I became proficient in <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> for both backend and frontend development. In school, which I attended two days a week alongside my apprenticeship, I also picked up <a href="www.java.com">Java</a> fundamentals. Additionally, I learned Bash scripting there, and one of my more interesting projects was a console-based game called <a href="https://github.com/joounii/20_wins_school">20 Wins</a>, which was created entirely with Bash.<br/><br/>
    My passion for learning didn’t stop at work or school. In my free time, I taught myself <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, which led to several exciting personal projects. With Python, I developed:<br/><br/>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/joounii/create_app_from_website">A tool that can create an executable from any website</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/joounii/py-perlin-noise">A Perlin Noise Generator for creating natural-looking random patterns</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/joounii/discord_server_bot">A Discord bot with some fun commands</a></li>
    </ul><br/>
    Unfortunately, after three years at <a href="https://www.open-circle.ch">Open Circle</a>, I had to pause my apprenticeship due to health reasons. However, that hasn't slowed down my progress or passion for coding. Currently, I’m working on two exciting projects:<br/><br/>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/joounii/simple-online-pygame">Multiplayer Pong Game</a> – This is a self-directed project aimed at teaching myself how multiplayer games work, how they communicate with servers, and how to implement the TCP protocol.</li>
        <li>Block Dodge – A mobile game built with Unity and C#. I’m aiming to release the first version of the game within the next six months.</li>
    </ul><br/>
    All my public projects, except for Block Dodge, can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/joounii">GitHub account</a>. Through every project and challenge, I continue to grow and improve as a developer, driven by a deep passion for coding and problem-solving.
